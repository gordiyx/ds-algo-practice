# ðŸ§  Data Structures & Algorithms â€“ University Projects

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithm implementations written as part of university coursework. Each file demonstrates a fundamental concept such as trees, graphs, hashing, sorting, and more â€” with a focus on clarity, correctness, and practical application.

|-----|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01  | **Array + Binary Search**   | Store historical data in a sorted array and search by year using binary search. |
| 02  | **Double Hashing**          | Insert and search in a hash table using double hashing for collision resolution. |
| 03  | **Queue via Stacks**        | Simulate a FIFO queue using two LIFO stacks.                                |
| 04  | **Tree Traversal**          | Depth-first traversal of a general tree where children are stored as linked siblings. |
| 05  | **Binary Search Tree**      | Store and manage a sorted list of names with insert/delete/traversal.       |
| 06  | **BST â€“ WTA Ranking**       | Store WTA player scores and find the k-th ranked player efficiently.        |
| 07  | **AVL Tree â€“ GDP Data**     | Balanced BST storing GDP values per quarter, with automatic rebalancing.    |
| 08  | **Red-Black Tree**          | Manage student points with efficient updates and lookups.                   |
| 09  | **B-Tree**                  | Store max daily temperatures using B-Tree logic (simplified).               |
| 10  | **Graph â€“ BFS**             | Find all reachable cities and path lengths using Breadth-First Search.      |
| 11  | **Graph â€“ Dijkstra**        | Find shortest distances from a source city using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.      |
| 12  | **Library System**          | Add, borrow, and return books using a simple list-based structure.          |
